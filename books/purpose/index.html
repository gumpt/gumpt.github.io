            <p>I read a lot and want to share.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the most prolific reader I know personally or know of online (those
would be my oldest sister and Charity Majors, respectively), but I read enough
that people sometimes ask me for book recommendations. I often end up
recommending the same books over and over to different people.</p>
<p>I keep a list of what I&rsquo;ve read for myself, but I&rsquo;m going to start writing about
some here with some small snippets and thoughts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of an exercise in vanity, but hopefully someone finds something on
here they wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise read. At the very least, I can be a target for
the same snark I direct towards other famous reading lists.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>From a quick glance, <a href="//www.gatesnotes.com">Bill Gates</a> wants you to know that:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Cloud Atlas</em> <a href="//www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Cloud-Atlas">is a good book</a>.</li>
<li>Thomas Piketty has errors both in his <a href="//www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Why-Inequality-Matters-Capital-in-21st-Century-Review">diagnosis and
prescription</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>My brain for each of these went down the rabbit-holes of:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Cloud Atlas</em> fits into David Mitchell&rsquo;s canon in an interesting way,
expanding both on the not-quite-shared past and near-future he explores in
other books more fully, but I thought the narrative gimmick inspired by
Calvino&rsquo;s <em>If on a winter&rsquo;s night a traveler</em> distracts from the throughline
of each story. I think Wachowskis agreed with me, as seen in the <a href="//youtu.be/7Y0JzIP-c30?t=18">film
adaptation</a> where &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would also say a wealth tax is misguided if I had
109.4 billion dollars.</p>
<p>That he first points to consumption data to say the poor aren&rsquo;t <em>really</em>
poor in rich countries only to then propose futher taxing consumption hurts
my head. He can&rsquo;t help himself and even proposes carve-outs for political
donations in his ideal tax strategy!</p>
<p>Bill Gates may want to employ a better editor for his arguments that he does not
<a href="//www.businessinsider.com/crazy-facts-about-bill-gates-house-2016-11">have too much money</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To be fair, I imagine that Mr. Gates does not actually write each of the reviews
on his blog, and he also has plenty to read and write about critically
besides postmodern literature. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
