      <title>Having and Being Had</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;a href=&#34;//bookshop.org/books/having-and-being-had/9780525537458&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having and Being Had&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Eula Biss earlier this
weekend. Biss tries to walk through her ascent from starving artist to gardening
homeowner, her discomfort at the tension between her egalitarian principles and
the comfortable space she has created for her life and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s short, with some wistful and ironic witticisms from the author mixed with
generous quotations of David Graeber, Binyamin Appelbaum, Alison Light, and
others. Biss precisely defines similar words (splitting the hairs between labor,
toil, and work) and identifying the metaphors or euphemisms (the &amp;ldquo;Opulence
White&amp;rdquo; she considers painting a room, the possible double meanings of
&amp;ldquo;aggressive investing&amp;rdquo;) we use to avoid thinking about them more closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt like I was reading an alternate universe version of &lt;a href=&#34;//bookshop.org/books/how-to-do-nothing-resisting-the-attention-economy/9781612197494&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How To Do
Nothing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, not only because they both star &lt;a href=&#34;//www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/arts/design/mierle-laderman-ukeles-new-york-city-sanitation-department.html&#34;&gt;Mierle Ukeles&lt;/a&gt; as a
prime example of work and systems re-examined, but also because it was
unsatisfying, half of a meal. When writing about what she finds displeasing
about driving cars, Biss writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cars make you stupid, in the way wealth makes you stupid. In the way any sort
of power makes you stupid, really. And it is this, my own stupidity, that I
dislike most about driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For her, there is nothing to be done but sit with the discomfort and feel better
for knowing we feel it. I&amp;rsquo;d read more Graeber for solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Purpose</title>
      <link>https://blog.gum.pt/notes/purpose/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a lot and want to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not the most prolific reader I know personally or know of online (those
would be my oldest sister and Charity Majors, respectively), but I read enough
that people sometimes ask me for book recommendations. I often end up
recommending the same books over and over to different people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep a list of what I&amp;rsquo;ve read for myself, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to start writing about
some here with some small snippets and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an exercise in vanity, but hopefully someone finds something on
here they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have otherwise read. At the very least, I can be a target for
the same snark I direct towards other famous reading lists.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a quick glance, &lt;a href=&#34;//www.gatesnotes.com&#34;&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; wants you to know that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cloud Atlas&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;//www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Cloud-Atlas&#34;&gt;is a good book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas Piketty has errors both in his &lt;a href=&#34;//www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Why-Inequality-Matters-Capital-in-21st-Century-Review&#34;&gt;diagnosis and
prescription&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brain for each of these went down the rabbit-holes of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cloud Atlas&lt;/em&gt; fits into David Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s canon in an interesting way,
expanding both on the not-quite-shared past and near-future he explores in
other books more fully, but I thought the narrative gimmick inspired by
Calvino&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;If on a winter&amp;rsquo;s night a traveler&lt;/em&gt; distracts from the throughline
of each story. I think Wachowskis agreed with me, as seen in the &lt;a href=&#34;//youtu.be/7Y0JzIP-c30?t=18&#34;&gt;film
adaptation&lt;/a&gt; where &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also say a wealth tax is misguided if I had
109.4 billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That he first points to consumption data to say the poor aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;
poor in rich countries only to then propose futher taxing consumption hurts
my head. He can&amp;rsquo;t help himself and even proposes carve-outs for political
donations in his ideal tax strategy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates may want to employ a better editor for his arguments that he does not
&lt;a href=&#34;//www.businessinsider.com/crazy-facts-about-bill-gates-house-2016-11&#34;&gt;have too much money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I imagine that Mr. Gates does not actually write each of the reviews
on his blog, and he also has plenty to read and write about critically
besides postmodern literature. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
