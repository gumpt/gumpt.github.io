      <title>Graeber&#39;s Oeuvre</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I could write like anyone, I would write like David Graeber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that based on how the first writing of his in &lt;em&gt;The Baffler&lt;/em&gt; I came
across&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; wormed its way into my brain, a reference whenever I had to spend too
much of my day doing &amp;ldquo;busywork,&amp;rdquo; figuring out why the tickets in the bug tracker
had a cyclical reference making the root of the cause undecipherable, filling
out status updates in three separate but Very Important places, listening to
friends describe what ran them out of academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that based on his political analysis, having referenced his &lt;a href=&#34;https://nymag.com/nymetro/realestate/neighborhoods/features/14884/&#34;&gt;analysis of
British elections
post-Brexit&lt;/a&gt;
more often than anything else when trying to describe fundamental political
problems in the United States to anyone else, or predict (somewhat accurately)
what would happen in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that because he had a knack for calling out bullshit and naming it such,
going semi-viral for calling the current state of work an epidemic of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/&#34;&gt;Bullshit
Jobs&lt;/a&gt;, later expanding the thesis into a
book, writing so many sentences that made me want to yell and scream and stamp
my feet that someone finally knows what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about, has their finger
on the pulse but the larger picture in mind, an acute and terminal understanding
of the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer clearly isn&amp;rsquo;t economic: it&amp;rsquo;s moral and political. The ruling
class has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time
on their hands is a mortal danger (think of what started to happen when this
even began to be approximated in the &amp;rsquo;60s). And, on the other hand, the
feeling that work is a moral value in itself, and that anyone not willing to
submit themselves to some kind of intense work discipline for most of their
waking hours deserves nothing, is extraordinarily convenient for them.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that because his humor comes through despite this subject matter, how
bureaucratic structures in our government are reflected in our languages and
thoughts, how The Left was fighting (and losing!) the wrong battles, how there
would never be The Revolution, the one moment where you could point to a Before
and an After, clearly demarcated by drastic improvements in people&amp;rsquo;s lives, but
that we need to work every single day to try to make the world around us what it
needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone once figured out that the average American will spend a cumulative six
months of life waiting for traffic lights to change. I donâ€™t know if similar
figures are available for how long it takes to fill out forms, but it must be
at least as long. No population in the history of the world has spent nearly
so much time engaged in paperwork.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of his books, articles, blog posts, interviews, tweets, coughs and other
gutteral utterances, are worth reading closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A footnote is required to note how wonderful the title is: &lt;a href=&#34;https://thebaffler.com/salvos/of-flying-cars-and-the-declining-rate-of-profit&#34;&gt;Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/&#34;&gt;https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Having and Being Had</title>
      <link>https://blog.gum.pt/notes/having-and-being-had/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2020 21:19:02 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.gum.pt/notes/having-and-being-had/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;a href=&#34;//bookshop.org/books/having-and-being-had/9780525537458&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having and Being Had&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Eula Biss earlier this
weekend. Biss tries to walk through her ascent from starving artist to gardening
homeowner, her discomfort at the tension between her egalitarian principles and
the comfortable space she has created for her life and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s short, with some wistful and ironic witticisms from the author mixed with
generous quotations of David Graeber, Binyamin Appelbaum, Alison Light, and
others. Biss precisely defines similar words (splitting the hairs between labor,
toil, and work) and identifying the metaphors or euphemisms (the &amp;ldquo;Opulence
White&amp;rdquo; she considers painting a room, the possible double meanings of
&amp;ldquo;aggressive investing&amp;rdquo;) we use to avoid thinking about them more closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt like I was reading an alternate universe version of &lt;a href=&#34;//bookshop.org/books/how-to-do-nothing-resisting-the-attention-economy/9781612197494&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How To Do
Nothing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, not only because they both star &lt;a href=&#34;//www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/arts/design/mierle-laderman-ukeles-new-york-city-sanitation-department.html&#34;&gt;Mierle Ukeles&lt;/a&gt; as a
prime example of work and systems re-examined, but also because it was
unsatisfying, half of a meal. When writing about what she finds displeasing
about driving cars, Biss writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cars make you stupid, in the way wealth makes you stupid. In the way any sort
of power makes you stupid, really. And it is this, my own stupidity, that I
dislike most about driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For her, there is nothing to be done but sit with the discomfort and feel better
for knowing we feel it. I&amp;rsquo;d read more Graeber for solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Purpose</title>
      <link>https://blog.gum.pt/notes/purpose/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 12:23:26 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.gum.pt/notes/purpose/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a lot and want to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not the most prolific reader I know personally or know of online (those
would be my oldest sister and Charity Majors, respectively), but I read enough
that people sometimes ask me for book recommendations. I often end up
recommending the same books over and over to different people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep a list of what I&amp;rsquo;ve read for myself, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to start writing about
some here with some small snippets and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an exercise in vanity, but hopefully someone finds something on
here they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have otherwise read. At the very least, I can be a target for
the same snark I direct towards other famous reading lists.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a quick glance, &lt;a href=&#34;//www.gatesnotes.com&#34;&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; wants you to know that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cloud Atlas&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;//www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Cloud-Atlas&#34;&gt;is a good book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas Piketty has errors both in his &lt;a href=&#34;//www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Why-Inequality-Matters-Capital-in-21st-Century-Review&#34;&gt;diagnosis and
prescription&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brain for each of these went down the rabbit-holes of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cloud Atlas&lt;/em&gt; fits into David Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s canon in an interesting way,
expanding both on the not-quite-shared past and near-future he explores in
other books more fully, but I thought the narrative gimmick inspired by
Calvino&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;If on a winter&amp;rsquo;s night a traveler&lt;/em&gt; distracts from the throughline
of each story. I think Wachowskis agreed with me, as seen in the &lt;a href=&#34;//youtu.be/7Y0JzIP-c30?t=18&#34;&gt;film
adaptation&lt;/a&gt; where &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also say a wealth tax is misguided if I had
109.4 billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That he first points to consumption data to say the poor aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;
poor in rich countries only to then propose futher taxing consumption hurts
my head. He can&amp;rsquo;t help himself and even proposes carve-outs for political
donations in his ideal tax strategy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates may want to employ a better editor for his arguments that he does not
&lt;a href=&#34;//www.businessinsider.com/crazy-facts-about-bill-gates-house-2016-11&#34;&gt;have too much money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I imagine that Mr. Gates does not actually write each of the reviews
on his blog, and he also has plenty to read and write about critically
besides postmodern literature.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
