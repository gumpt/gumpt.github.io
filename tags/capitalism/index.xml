      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;a href=&#34;//bookshop.org/books/having-and-being-had/9780525537458&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having and Being Had&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Eula Biss earlier this
weekend. Biss tries to walk through her ascent from starving artist to gardening
homeowner, her discomfort at the tension between her egalitarian principles and
the comfortable space she has created for her life and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s short, with some wistful and ironic witticisms from the author mixed with
generous quotations of David Graeber, Binyamin Appelbaum, Alison Light, and
others. Biss precisely defines similar words (splitting the hairs between labor,
toil, and work) and identifying the metaphors or euphemisms (the &amp;ldquo;Opulence
White&amp;rdquo; she considers painting a room, the possible double meanings of
&amp;ldquo;aggressive investing&amp;rdquo;) we use to avoid thinking about them more closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt like I was reading an alternate universe version of &lt;a href=&#34;//bookshop.org/books/how-to-do-nothing-resisting-the-attention-economy/9781612197494&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How To Do
Nothing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, not only because they both star &lt;a href=&#34;//www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/arts/design/mierle-laderman-ukeles-new-york-city-sanitation-department.html&#34;&gt;Mierle Ukeles&lt;/a&gt; as a
prime example of work and systems re-examined, but also because it was
unsatisfying, half of a meal. When writing about what she finds displeasing
about driving cars, Biss writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cars make you stupid, in the way wealth makes you stupid. In the way any sort
of power makes you stupid, really. And it is this, my own stupidity, that I
dislike most about driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For her, there is nothing to be done but sit with the discomfort and feel better
for knowing we feel it. I&amp;rsquo;d read more Graeber for solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
